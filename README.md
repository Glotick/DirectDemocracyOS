### **Concept of an Electronic System of State Governance and People's Rule**

**Core Goals and Principles:**
It is necessary to develop an electronic system of state governance and people's rule, without officials and deputies! All officials of state bodies, local, communal servants, budget workers, etc., should be thrown into the market competition of goods and services! The main goal is building the future, not destroying society from within right now.

Full automation of all civil needs, built on the elementary principles of the connections between a person's "statuses" and "property"! The data processing itself is essentially the simplest script that compares "statuses" and "rights" against templates of correspondences.

### **Structure of the New System**

**1. Judicial and Legal System:**
Leave only unified online courts with online juries. No data about the jurors or the judge is disseminated; faces are not shown, only the narration of the court's discussions, lawyers, and voices. The system automatically selects any judge and jurors and provides electronic case materials. Also, create professional and legal communities (online chats).

**2. Financial System:**
A unified online banking, pension, and insurance system as closed parallel banking accounts within the citizens themselves (like savings accounts). There should be only 1 account per person with different purposes for funds (income card, pension savings, insurance, etc.), but with restrictions on their use. Money has unique ID records for different types. There will be no separate banks, but a single global online banking with a single electronic currency.

**3. Education:**
Online learning, education based on lists of online courses and online tests. Education in the future is also a matter of private business; tenders are announced for the development of training courses according to voted-upon laws.

**4. Law Enforcement and Emergency Services:**
Leave 20% of the police, 100% of doctors, firefighters, and emergency responders, but on a system of civil assessment of their work quality. The evaluation system works based on anonymous voting (likes/stars) by each patient or client; the assessment can be changed at any time. Data is collected over the entire month and displayed as an average. No one can be condemned for their assessment. At the end of the month, the funding amount for each institution is automatically assigned based on the quality assessment. Also, leave the military, but with a lot of restrictions.

**5. Legislation:**
Reduce the legislative field by 80% due to the absence of controlling bodies. Laws will consist not only of text but also of program code, 3D project models, geolocation markers, financial and accounting formulas. According to participation in professional unions (specialized chats), everyone will be able to work on laws according to their qualifications. This will completely simplify the understanding of the state's structure.

**6. Work and Social Security:**
According to participation in professional unions, a job search for the unemployed will occur automatically. If a person loses their job or their financial status falls below a specified level not due to their own wastefulness but due to health, social payments and benefits are automatically accrued.

### **Automatic Statuses and Their Functions**

The servers are independently capable of automatically assigning any status to a person from birth to death. The two main databases are: about a person's property rights and their statuses.

**Examples of Statuses and Their Actions:**
*   **Birth/Death:** Primary points. Recorded with electronic signatures of relatives, the chief physician, and a law enforcement officer (or witnesses/judge if no relatives). Each encrypts 1/3 of the data with their signature. Mandatory DNA testing to avoid errors.
*   **Adult:** Automatically gains access to the system of people's rule, bank accounts, professional union chats.
*   **Schoolchild, Student.**
*   **Disabled/Low-income:** Automatic accruals from the state budget. The status is also certified by signatures of a doctor, relatives, witnesses.
*   **Believer** or **Left the Church.**
*   **Military.**
*   **Retiree:** Automatic pension deductions from their account.
*   **Deceased:** Automatic distribution of property, savings, investments among relatives or debt write-off. A semi-automatic function: assets are distributed, real estate is alienated to the state for sale through an Exchange with priority for relatives.

Virtually every aspect of a person's life is automated.

### **Technical Implementation and Security**

**Data Protection:**
Databases are built on a blockchain system (mechanics of record entries with duplication of reverse linkage tables and hash sums of all records to detect tampering attempts). Data access is completely closed to users. The system is needed for backup and protection of records.

**Transaction Verification:**
The automatic system determines if a payment device belongs to a person (according to the property rights table) and blocks suspicious transactions.

**Containerization and System Security:**
The system automatically creates routing rules, generates private and public keys for containerized services. Even system administrators do not have access due to the lack of keys. All software changes are introduced only through the mechanism of proposing and voting on laws.

### **The Process of Lawmaking and People's Rule**

Everyone can submit proposals for laws and amendments, discussing them in specialized chats. Everyone can evaluate posts (likes/dislikes). For spam or non-constructive proposals, the system automatically lowers the rating and visibility of comments and may temporarily block access. The rating level is restored over time.

Voting on laws can last a month. If a law is adopted (more than 51%), its software implementation is launched in a test mode for six months. After successful testing, it is transferred to the main system. For quick decisions (within 1-2 days), an emergency referendum is possible, but only under a state of emergency.

**The Role of Professional Unions:**
Every worker or student (from 18 years old) gets access to professional unions (chats by profession). Their vote in elections has a weight from 0.5 to 1, depending on qualification level, work experience, and rating (which can be lowered for spam).

### **Transition Period and Social Stability**

**Transition Principles:**
I am against any revolutions. For people's assemblies (viƒçe) and referendums. Against spending resources on persecuting corrupt officials. People from the old system (officials, budget workers) must be provided with a transition period. In total, this is 5 million people, and their abrupt exclusion is a strong blow to the economy and society.

**Action Plan:**
*   Maintain the operation of old bodies for at least a year for the possibility of rollback.
*   Civil servants and officials under 40 undergo free retraining (paid from the state budget).
*   Those over 40 have a choice: retirement with lifelong support or retraining.
*   This will prevent social upheavals, economic collapse, and revolutions.

### **Personal Position and Conclusions**

**My Position:**
I do not claim ownership of this knowledge. You can copy and republish it. Personally, I do not want to participate in the development of such a system (I am not a great programmer), although I can describe its general concepts.

**A Warning:**
The system must be built OUTSIDE the old principles of state-building. If created on the basis of the existing state as a tool for individual bodies, it will lead to the concentration of power in the hands of ~200 people, electronic dictatorship, and tyranny. What the government has been doing for the last 6 years (automating individual bodies) leads to monopolization and usurpation of power.

**Vision of the Future:**
This is a civilizational leap. The need to work more than 2-3 days a week for 4 hours will disappear. The system will offer people the acquisition of new knowledge, government functions, and scientific work. The focus of life will shift from work to participation in governance. Everyone will be in abundance, offenders will be fined, the hardworking will be rewarded by society. This is the inevitable future of all humanity, which will sooner or later become everyday reality.
