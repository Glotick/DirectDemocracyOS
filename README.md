DirectDemocracyOS is an experimental digital governance system combining automated citizen participation, containerized microservices, blockchain-secured data, and law sandboxing. It allows citizens to vote, create budgets, propose laws, and monitor public services, while ensuring transparency, security, and system integrity.
